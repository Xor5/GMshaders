                        At this point, you have general overview of shaders. This tutorial is aimed at teaching some useful trick for optimizing, error checking and some useful code snippets. Feel free to just play around with shaders and come back to this later if you're not ready.

                    <p>
                        When I was first learning about shaders, it was difficult for me to tell what code was efficient and what would be slow. After all, you can't easily run code on thousands of pixels in GML, but shaders can with ease. At the same time many shaders can struggle with if-statements and for-loops, while GML has no such problem. So that's what I'd like to cover now.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Tips</h3>
                    <p>
                        So here's a list of things to consider.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Constants:</strong>
                                uniforms, precision
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Fragment-vertex:</strong>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Loops:</strong>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Branching:</strong>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Textures and multipass:</strong>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Vector:</strong>
                                Swizzle
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        Compile time.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Preprocessor</h3>
                    <p>
                        The preprocessor is used to "process" the shader code during compilation (not runtime). For example, with <code>#define</code>, you can define a macro value, let's say 'pi', and it will replace all references of 'pi' with that value (just like <a href="https://docs2.yoyogames.com/source/_build/3_scripting/3_gml_overview/6_scope.html" target="_blank">GML macros</a>). Every time you run the game, the preprocessor will compile those changes as though you hardcoded those values in, making it a good choice for values you may want to change later.
                        <br>
                        Here's a list of the supported preprocessor directives:
                        <br>
                        <strong>#define, #undef, #ifdef, #ifndef, #if, #endif, #else, #elif, </strong>
                        <br>
                        So you know that '#define' can define a value like constants, but, like GML macros, it can also hold expressions such as <code class="glsl">#define add a + b</code> or you can use it like a function with custom values like: <code class="glsl">#define add(a,b) a + b</code>.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Note:</strong> This code directly replaces its references, so you probably don't want to put a semi-colon at the end of your expression, if you already have one on that line! And since it's like copy-pasting, you'll want to make sure you're not repeating computations that only need to be done once.
                        <br>
                        The next directive is '#undef', which as you may have guessed, can be used to undefine macros, which can be used to avoid naming conflicts. '#ifdef' and `ifndef` are preprocessor if statements to check if a macro is defined (or not, respectively). Instead of brackets, you use '#endif' to close the statement, and any lines in between will be discarded (during compile) if the condition is false. Some people like to leave optional bits of code in their shader that can be toggled on with a define.
                        <br>
                        Next is '#if', which can be used for standard conditionals</span> (e.g ==, >, etc). Just make sure the terms in the condition are constant values, macros!
                        <br>
                        And finally, you have '#else' and '#elif' which work how you'd expect, being an else statement and else-if respectively. To recap, here's a quick example:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="glsl">#define mode 0 //Try changing this to 0, 1 or 2.

#if (mode == 0)
color *= vec3(1.0, 0.1, 0.1); //Multiply "color" by a red filter.
#elif (mode == 1)
color *= vec3(0.2, 1.0, 0.1); //Mulitply by a green filter.
#else
color = color.rrr; //Use mono-color from red channel.
#endif

#undef mode</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        So that's how you can make your code more customizable without taking runtime performance! You'll thank yourself later for not leaving magic numbers everywhere.
                    </p>

                    It's time to talk more about matrices in more depth. <a href="/glossary/?load=dot" target="_blank">dot</a>

                    <h3>Colors and brightness</h3>
                    <p>
                        For some effects (like sepia-tone or grayscale) you need to compute the brightness of a color. I'll go over the two most common approaches.
                        <div class="image"><img src="./grayscale.png">
                            <em>On the left is the original color for reference, the middle is the RGB average and the right is a weighted average.</em>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        The first approach is to simply compute the average of the red, green, and blue channels:
                        <pre><code class="glsl">float average = (color.r+color.g+color.b)/3.0;</code></pre>
                        So if any one channel is brightened, it increases the output brightness, up to a max brightness of 1.0.
                        <br>
                        The second approach is to approximate "perceptive" brightness. For example, lime green appears brighter than blue even if they have the same RGB average. So instead of giving red, green, and blue the same weight, we'll give green a higher weight and blue a lower weight:
                        <pre><code class="glsl">float weighted = dot(color.rgb, vec3(0.299, 0.587, 0.114));</code></pre>
                        The <a href="/glossary/?load=dot" target="_blank">dot</a> product simply adds up the color's red value times 0.299, green times 0.587, and blue times 0.114 which also adds up to a max value of 1.0. These come from fairly standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luma_(video)#Rec._601_luma_versus_Rec._709_luma_coefficients" target="_blank">luma</a> values. There are more many more sophisticated compute brightness, but this is adequate for most game effects.
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Gamma correction</h3>
                    <p>
                        One thing you might not know is that 50% brightness (or 0.5 RGB) is not displayed at 50% brightness on your monitor. Instead, it's displayed at around 73% brightness because the output is not linear.
                        <div class="image"><img src="./gamma.png">
                            <em>On the top is a linear-gradient, and the bottom is gamma corrected. Notice the top, middle section looks too bright.</em>
                        </div>
                        Thankfully, it's easy to compute and to reverse. Just put a color's RGB channels to a power of 2.2 to decode and 0.4545 (or the reciprocal of 2.2) to encode.
                        <pre><code class="glsl">vec3 encode = pow(color.rgb, vec3(2.2));
vec3 decode = pow(color.rgb, vec3(0.4545));</code></pre>
