Its values can be accessed with `.r`, `.a`, `.rgba`, etc. This is useful for storing color values with an alpha channel, but can be used as a container for any kind of data. Arithmetic operations performed on a vec4 object will be applied to each component of the vec4 object. `vec4(1. - vec4(.4, .2, .2, .3))` will create a vec4 object with .6 red, .8 green, .8 blue and .7 alpha. `vec4()` does not demand all arguments be satisfied. `vec4(.8)` will create a vec4 object and fill each channel with .8. It is equivalent to doing `vec4(.8, .8, .8, .8)`",
