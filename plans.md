## planned features

*   a footer so people know where the page ends
*   tutorials linking to next/previous tutorials, with some metadata displayed
*   a list that shows titles/highlights from paragraphs/points in the text, same way this one works: https://tonystr.net/test/generated/digitocracy â€¦
*   button for sharing tutorial on twitter (can have multiple buttons for multiple platforms if you'd like)
*   Glossary search bar
*   Glossary entry links
*   Dynamic loading of Glossary entries (it'll probably be a very big page if every glossary entry loaded at once)


## implemented (done)

* Fix white theme in glossary
